# IOT_Final_Project

Our project is a smart bird feeder. The bird feeder will dispense food to approaching birds. There
is a motion sensor set up in the front of the bird feeder which will trigger when an animal
approaches. A camera will take a picture of the animal. If the animal is correctly identified by a trained
model as a bird, then a mechanism will trigger, dispensing bird food for the bird. If the animal is a
squirrel, however, then a noise will play and startle the squirrel.
